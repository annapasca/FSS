To install the FSS plugin, just save the 'process_fss.m' file into
"user_folder/.brainstorm/process/"
where "user_folder" stands for your Brainstorm installation folder.
This will make the process available in the pipeline editor menus,
when you use the Process1 or Process2 tabs.
Avoid using capital letters, spaces or special characters in the process file name.
